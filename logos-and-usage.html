<p>This logo is to be used whenever possible. It should be transparent and a single colour. Don't skew it. It doesn't need to be massive, but shouldn't be too small either.</p>

<h2>The logo and images</h2>

<div class="slideshow view extend" data-view="SlideshowView">
  <div class="slide">
    <img src="./images/logo-usage.1.png" />
    <p><span class="ok">OK.</span> Positioning the logo along an edge breaks up the structure of the layout.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    <img src="./images/logo-usage.2.png" />
    <p><span class="ok">OK.</span> Only overlapping one edge. With greyscale images a colour can lift the logo off the image and tie together the composition.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    <img src="./images/logo-usage.3.png" />
    <p><span class="not-ok">NOT OK.</span> Overlapping the logo with two edges makes it look too much like <a href="http://pilotmagazine.co.nz" target="_blank">PILOT</a>. Colour chosen doesn't contrast with the tones in the image enough.</p>
